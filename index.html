          <h4><span>Tiffany Conroy:</span> Design Processes, Not Interfaces</h4>
          <p>
            Computers are tools that help people accomplish tasks by making the process easier, faster, cheaper, less error-prone, or just more fun.
            But what tasks? And by what process? What parts of the process can the computer make better? How can users interact with the computer to make it do its part of the process? Only lastly can we ask: what must be presented to the user and how?
          </p>
          <p class="speaker_info">
            Tiffany is a Canadian living in Berlin doing front-end development and interaction design at SoundCloud at SoundCloud.

         It’s up.front 25! Spring is here, and so is our first Really Rather Big Number™ meetup. We’ve found some great speakers for our 25th edition, and we’re very much looking forward to both you and them.
      </p>
      <p>
         Up.front takes place in the comfy confines of the <a href="http://co-up.de/">co.up co-working space</a> in Kreuzberg, Adalbertstraße 7-8, on the 10th of April at 19:30.
       </p>

       <p>
         Spread the word, show us cool stuff, learn new things at up.front.ug!

          <h4><span>Kelly Sutton, LayerVault:</span> From MVP to business in 9 months</h4>

          <p>LayerVault started as a Quora thread. "What are the tools or methods to manage design files?" Allan Grinshtein sent Kelly Sutton (me) an IM, "Man it sucks to be a designer. Think you could build something?" Sutton had a prototype ready to show off the next Monday. Nine months later, they are used by the best designers worldwide.</p>

          <p>While the days of LayerVault are still extremely early, there are quite a few lessons learned. Is "just ship it" always the best advice? What’s the best way to deal with copycats? How can I work as fast as humanly possible?</p>

          <p class="speaker_info">Kelly Sutton is a software developer from New York City. He’s currently traveling the world. In the past, he’s made HackCollege and the Cult of Less and worked for blip.tv and Gilt Groupe.</p>

          <h4><span>Till Wiedeck, HelloMe:</span> Big Pictures, Small Things</h4>

          <p>Till will be talking about the development of dynamic visual systems, approaching projects from a cross media perspective, ideas led design, trusting the process and the gain of not fearing failure.</p>

          <p class="speaker_info">
            Till Wiedeck is the founder of Berlin based design studio HelloMe.
