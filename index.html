       <h4><span>Paulo Zoom</span> Words of Matter</h4>
       <p>
         Words are living things. We shape them with our collective usage, and we perceive them differently as we change. As humans, they’re our interface with each other, and as designers, they’re our most essential tool.
       <br>
         In this talk, Paulo will discuss how caring about words, through proper copywriting and typography, plays a fundamental part in interface design.
       </p>
       <p class="speaker_info">
         Paulo designs websites. He’s working on <a href="http://everywhere.alwaysreadthemanual.com">The Manual</a> and <a href="http://xoxofest.com">XOXO</a>. That’s not his real name.

       <h4><span>Hany Rizk</span> UX &amp; Product: How lean can you go?</h4>
       <p>
         F**k it, ship it they say &mdash; but does that also apply when you're working on a completely new product? This talk will revolve around releasing a Minimal Viable Product and all the complications that come with it: How do you know when your MVP is ready, and is less really more?
       </p>
       <p class="speaker_info">
         Hany is a UX and Interaction Designer driven by minimalism, product strategy and bringing interaction beyond the screen. As a pianist with a passion for music, design, arts and humanities, Hany mixes those sources of inspiration with the technical challenges he faces to design intuitive and innovative solutions that are fun to use, shaken not stirred!

        <p>
        Whether it's photo sharing, loops or tweets, the social object reigns queen of the web. Starting with Jyri Engeström as our centre point I'll walk through findings from our own development in seeking the balance between accessible and precious design around social objects. How can we design platforms that lower barriers to create objects with long term social value?

        <h4><span>Tom O’Doherty</span>Zombie video</h4>
        <p>

          Tom is a freelance design and video person, originally from Ireland. He’s interested in design minimalism and succinct storytelling. And Japanese noise-rock.

        <h4>Skeumorphic Mess vs the Boring Flatlands: What’s a “Digitally Native User Interface”?</h4>
        <p>
  Over the past years, we’ve witnessed a constant debate about competing trends in our field: Mimicking real world objects in user interfaces versus a revived flat approach, which the proponents label as more content-focused, <i>digitally native</i> and even <i>honest</i>.
        <br>
  It’s time to put this into perspective. Is there more to this new flat trend than just a different level of polish and angry designer youth re-discovering modernism? How can a user interface be native and honest in the first place?
        <br>

  We’ll look at different approaches and whether they’re relevant. To get a broader contexts of terms used in the discussion, we’ll not only discuss interaction design and usability, but also will have a look at art history and architecture.
