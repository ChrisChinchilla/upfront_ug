         It’s up.front 25! Spring is here, and so is our first Really Rather Big Number™ meetup. We’ve found some great speakers for our 25th edition, and we’re very much looking forward to both you and them.
      </p>
      <p>
         As always, up.front takes place in the comfy confines of the <a href="http://co-up.de/">co.up co-working space</a> in Kreuzberg, Adalbertstraße 7-8, on the 10th of April at 19:30. Co.up offers a variety of cheap drinks and the biggest beanbags we’ve ever seen.

         Found out about a cool new tool or technology? Want to talk about a project that fits into the web design or frontend category? Share it with everyone and hold a talk! Plus: you’re always welcome to hold a more or less spontaneous lightning talk.
       </p>
       <p>
         Spread the word, show us cool stuff, learn new things at up.front.ug!

          <h4><span>Kelly Sutton, LayerVault:</span> From MVP to business in 9 months</h4>

          <p>LayerVault started as a Quora thread. "What are the tools or methods to manage design files?" Allan Grinshtein sent Kelly Sutton (me) an IM, "Man it sucks to be a designer. Think you could build something?" Sutton had a prototype ready to show off the next Monday. Nine months later, they are used by the best designers worldwide.</p>

          <p>While the days of LayerVault are still extremely early, there are quite a few lessons learned. Is "just ship it" always the best advice?. What’s the best way to deal with copycats? How can I work as fast as humanly possible?</p>

          <p class="speaker_info">Kelly Sutton is a software developer from New York City. He’s currently traveling the world. In the past, he’s made HackCollege and the Cult of Less and worked for blip.tv and Gilt Groupe.</p>
