        <p>
          We are happy to announce our 7th meetup. Today, September 14th at 7:30pm we will have…

        <ul id="talks" class="two">
          <li>
            <h4>Malte Müller: More pixels or none at all. Designing interfaces for better screens.</h4>
            <p>
              For once, Apple may have actually gotten it right with their
              advertising: The iPhone 4 changed everything. At least, if you're an
              interface designer. Dealing with different resolutions and screen
              sizes adds another dimension to both conceptual and technical
              interface design. My talk provides some basic thoughts and approaches
              concerning this issue.
            <br />
            Malte Müller runs <a href="http://www.electricgecko.de" title="electricgecko.de">electricgecko.de</a> by night and serves as Digital Director at <a href="http://www.fischerappelt-furore.de/">fischerAppelt, furore</a> by day.

            <h4>Jan Lehnardt: Minimal templating with Mustache.js</h4>
            <p>
            Jan will give a designer-friendly introduction to minimal templating with <a href="http://mustache.github.com/" title="mustache.github.com">Mustache.js</a> in JavaScript and explain why {{mustaches}} are awesome.
            <br />
            Jan Lehnardt is Cofounder and Vice President of <a href="http://www.couchone.com" title="couchone.com">CouchOne</a>. He’s also a drummer, cyclist and likes living in Berlin.

        </ul>

        <p>
          We also have got some free slots for lightning talks, so if you have
          found a cool new tool, technology, project or whatever fits into the
          frontend category of interest: Share it with us!
        </p>

          The world cup will be over after sunday, but the web never sleeps!
          Sorry for this cheesy line, but as you might notice: the next meetup
          is right ahead of us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next tuesday, 13th July at 7pm we will have <a href="http://sebastiankippe.de">Sebastian Kippe</a> around
          whose talk is a bit of the anti-thesis to <a href="http://momoi.de/future_of_flash">Alex Feyerke's talk</a> at the
          may meetup. Sebastian will tell us why he thinks that Alex sees
          Flash's future a bit too bright and why the new tools around HTML5
          will succeed over Flash.
