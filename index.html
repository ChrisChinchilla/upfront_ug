              <h4><span>Stephen Coles:</span> Cure for the Common Font — A Web Designer’s Introduction to Typeface Selection</h4>
              <p>
                Now that web designers suddenly face the challenge (and delight) of choosing fonts from an ever-growing selection, it’s a good time to recommend some basic principles for making wise type choices.
              </p>

              <h4><span>Gearóid O’Rourke:</span> Taking print design online</h4>
              <p>
              Newspapers are dying. Print is dead. All hail the online revolution! It has felled the inky beasts. Oh the confidence of teenagers. Web design is a discipline in it’s adolescence — the classic teenager; all existential angst, bad fashion choices, mood swings and earnest attempts at “cool”. It has rightly rejected the mistakes, constraints and pitfalls of “fuddy-duddy” print design, but has forgotten that old-man print still has more than a few things to teach.<br />
              Gearóid spent his teenage years in the world of newspapers. As the youngest designer at Ireland’s oldest newspaper he learned print design from the old hands. Teaching himself web design at the same time, he became fascinated by the insights a grounding in print design can offer to the web designer who is willing to listen. Gearóid will explore these insights under 3 headings – process, philosophy and practicalities.
              </p>
              <p class="speaker_info">
              Gearóid is a 24 year-old Irish guy who runs a one-man design studio in London. He has worked as an editorial designer with the News of the World, The Irish Times and the Sun. He welcomes our new online overlords in “the cloud”.

Producing for FvF is lots of fun in the first place and with the engagement of a creative network became a fertile ground for great client projects and new ideas in digital publishing.

              <p>
                For some people it is a trouble-maker in German orthography, for some a shortcoming in typography but to Nadine it is the most beautiful letter – The German Eszett. 
                Throughout history no other character has had to put up with so much and almost no other letter has been the subject of so much discussion. Her surname contains this rare character. That’s the reason why, in her thesis, she decided to put some thought into what could be done to place it in a better light. That was the basis of the project »Eine scharfe Type« – A sharp character.

FontFont is the world’s largest library of original contemporary typefaces. Together with Ivo Gabrowitsch and Jörg Haubrichs, head of marketing and developer at FontFont, the team at Edenspiekermann redesigned the website from scratch in a collaborative and agile way. Almost no Photoshop pixels were harmed in the making of the site. Instead, most of the design took place in the browser using tools such as Haml and Sass.

We laughed at the print people using InDesign, now it ships with pixel measures and we dream about the automatic recovery when Fireworks beachball crashed again. And of course beyond Adobe, who needs a flat demo of an interactive Design anyways, after all rapid prototyping has been around a while.<br /><a href="http://ulischoeberl.com">His talk</a> will showcase different case of Tool combinations, how they fit in a real world workflow and the own choice always seems superior to everyone elses.

            On December 14th we are going to gather for a special Christmas edition of our meet-up. Let’s enjoy some mulled wine, munch cookies and hear a lightning talk or two.
            If you want to share a cool new tool, technology or case that fits into the web design frontend category in a lightning talk (~5min), you are very welcome to share it with us.
          </p>

          <p>
            We would also like to plan the next meet-ups with you! Which topics do you want to discuss or would you like to be discussed? Do you think theme nights like the last one make sense or would you rather go for mixed evenings, etc.
            This is also a great chance to give us feedback about past events.
          </p>

          <p>PS: Baked some tasty cookies, bring ’em! :-)</p>

              <p>Open data is everywhere. Institutions and companies all around us start to open up their databases, provide APIs and give the Web community the power to build applications on top. But what if we could combine all that open data to build apps no only of one open data silo, but multiple, by cross-linking all that data data? Wouldn’t that be much more powerful?<br />This talk gives an intro to how this little idea - four years ago - became the Linking Open Data project, with hundreds of connected data sources.</p>

              <p>Handheld electronics, location devices, telecommunications networks, and a wide assortment of tags and sensors are constantly producing a rich stream of data reflecting various aspects of urban life. Managed well, “big data” can be used to unlock new sources of economic value, provide new insights into scions and hold governments to account. Meanwhile, some of the world’s foremost architects, planners, policymakers, builders, and thinkers are trying to understand this data to harness it for answers to our biggest problems.<br />In this talk, Edial Dekker will address the benefits of seeing cities as a platform that is able to reinvent itself. A main theme in this talk will be the role of data visualizations and a project called City Crawlers Berlin.</p>

              <p>
                For once, Apple may have actually gotten it right with their
                advertising: The iPhone 4 changed everything. At least, if you’re an
                interface designer. Dealing with different resolutions and screen
                sizes adds another dimension to both conceptual and technical
                interface design. My talk provides some basic thoughts and approaches
                concerning this issue.

            The world cup will be over after sunday, but the web never sleeps!
            Sorry for this cheesy line, but as you might notice: the next meetup
            is right ahead of us.
          </p>
          <p>
            On 13th July at 7pm we had <a href="http://sebastiankippe.de">Sebastian Kippe</a> around
            whose talk was a bit of the anti-thesis to <a href="http://momoi.de/future_of_flash">Alex Feyerke’s talk</a> at the
            may meetup. Sebastian told us why he thinks that Alex sees
            Flash’s future a bit too bright and why the new tools around HTML5
            will succeed over Flash.
