        <h4>Skeumorphic Mess vs the Boring Flatlands: What’s a <i>Digitally Native User Interface</i>?</h4>
        <p>
  Over the past years, we’ve witnessed a constant debate about competing trends in our field: Mimicking real world objects in user interfaces versus a revived flat approach, which the proponents label as more content-focused, <i>digitally native</i> and even <i>honest</i>.
        <br>
  It’s time to put this into perspective. Is there more to this new flat trend than just a different level of polish and angry designer youth re-discovering modernism? How can a user interface be native and honest in the first place?
        <br>

  We’ll look at different approaches and whether they’re relevant. To get a broader contexts of terms used in the discussion, we’ll not only discuss interaction design and usability, but also will have a look at art history and architecture.
