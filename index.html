            <p><a href="http://design.fh-potsdam.de/fachbereich/personen/portrait/nagel-till.html">Till Nagel</a> gives a short introduction how interactive maps and geo visualization help to explore and communicate multivariate data, and shows a few examples on tangible and multitouch data vis applications.</p>

            <h4>Georgi Kobilarov: When 1+1=3. On linking open data.</h4>
            
            <p>Open data is everywhere. Institutions and companies all around us start to open up their databases, provide APIs and give the Web community the power to build applications on top. But what if we could combine all that open data to build apps no only of one open data silo, but multiple, by cross-linking all that data data? Wouldn't that be much more powerful?<br />This talk gives an intro to how this little idea - four years ago - became the Linking Open Data project, with hundreds of connected data sources.</p>
            
            <p><a href="http://twitter.com/gkob">Georgi</a> is the founder of Uberblic Labs, a company of data geeks in Berlin. He developed <a href="http://dbpedia.org">DBpedia</a>, one of the first Linked Data projects, and helped organisations such as the BBC to use the Web as their database.</p>

            <h4>Edial Dekker: The Networked City</h4>
            
            <p>Handheld electronics, location devices, telecommunications networks, and a wide assortment of tags and sensors are constantly producing a rich stream of data reflecting various aspects of urban life. Managed well, “big data” can be used to unlock new sources of economic value, provide new insights into scions and hold governments to account. Meanwhile, some of the world's foremost architects, planners, policymakers, builders, and thinkers are trying to understand this data to harness it for answers to our biggest problems.<br />In this talk, Edial Dekker will address the benefits of seeing cities as a platform that is able to reinvent itself. A main theme in this talk will be the role of data visualizations and a project called City Crawlers Berlin.</p>
            
            <p><a href="http://twitter.com/edial">Edial</a> is part of <a href="http://yourneighbours.de">Your Neighbours</a>, a studio that is focussed on visualizing data and story telling.</p>

            <h4>Christoph Rauscher: Using commercial webfonts</h4>
            
            <p>Webfonts seem to be the new savior in webdesign. We are free from Verdana, Helvetica and Georgia, finally! Or actually could be. In fact, one hardly knows anything about the implementation of commercial fonts on the web. I want to give a short introduction to typekit, .woff, .eot &amp; co, but rather want to hear about your opinions and experiences.<br /><a href="http://christowski.de">Christoph Rauscher</a>, grown up in the interwebs, is a student of interface design and likes everything regarding (type) design.</p>

            <h4>Alex Coles and Sven Ellingen: Rebooting the Edenspiekermann website</h4>
            
            <p>Alex and Sven – Developer and Designer at Edenspiekermann – will share their experience relaunching the design agency’s website in a 2-day-marathon. They’ll offer insight into the tools they used, and explain why they kicked out their CMS in favour of a mostly static solution. Learn about the roadblocks they encountered in the last few minutes, and why this rapid reboot is more than just an academic exercise.<br /><a href="http://new.edenspiekermann.com">Edenspiekermann</a> is an agency for strategy, design and communication with offices in Amsterdam, Berlin, Stuttgart.</p>

            <h4>Malte Müller: More pixels or none at all. Designing interfaces for better screens.</h4>
            <p>
              For once, Apple may have actually gotten it right with their
              advertising: The iPhone 4 changed everything. At least, if you’re an
              interface designer. Dealing with different resolutions and screen
              sizes adds another dimension to both conceptual and technical
              interface design. My talk provides some basic thoughts and approaches
              concerning this issue.
            <br />

          The world cup will be over after sunday, but the web never sleeps!
          Sorry for this cheesy line, but as you might notice: the next meetup
          is right ahead of us.
        </p>
        <p>
          On 13th July at 7pm we had <a href="http://sebastiankippe.de">Sebastian Kippe</a> around
          whose talk was a bit of the anti-thesis to <a href="http://momoi.de/future_of_flash">Alex Feyerke's talk</a> at the
          may meetup. Sebastian told us why he thinks that Alex sees
          Flash's future a bit too bright and why the new tools around HTML5
          will succeed over Flash.
