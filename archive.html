              <p>
                Every company thinks about how to present their app. But is it more important to present the company’s style or to make an app that looks good on its platform? Is it more important to have a light blue status bar or to have one that doesn’t break your own guidelines. That’s what Max Fellmuth wants to discuss with you. Max spends his whole day doing UI design (and school) and will give some insights to good and also bad branding in apps.

            On our 15th meetup we had Gearóid O’Rourke, Frederik Frede &amp; Tim Seifert, and Stephen Coles. Lightning talks by Karl Westin, Robb Böhnke and Johan Uhle.

              <h4><span>Stephen Coles:</span> Cure for the Common Font — A Web Designer’s Introduction to Typeface Selection</h4>
              <p>
                Now that web designers suddenly face the challenge (and delight) of choosing fonts from an ever-growing selection, it’s a good time to recommend some basic principles for making wise type choices.
              </p>
              <p class="speaker_info">
                Stephen is a writer and designer living in Oakland and Berlin. After six years at FontShop San Francisco as a creative director, he now publishes the websites Typographica, Fonts In Use, and The Mid-Century Modernist. Stephen is also a regular contributor to Print magazine and a member of the FontFont TypeBoard.

              <h4><span>Gearóid O’Rourke:</span> Taking print design online</h4>
              <p>
              Newspapers are dying. Print is dead. All hail the online revolution! It has felled the inky beasts. Oh the confidence of teenagers. Web design is a discipline in it’s adolescence — the classic teenager; all existential angst, bad fashion choices, mood swings and earnest attempts at “cool”. It has rightly rejected the mistakes, constraints and pitfalls of “fuddy-duddy” print design, but has forgotten that old-man print still has more than a few things to teach.<br />
              Gearóid spent his teenage years in the world of newspapers. As the youngest designer at Ireland’s oldest newspaper he learned print design from the old hands. Teaching himself web design at the same time, he became fascinated by the insights a grounding in print design can offer to the web designer who is willing to listen. Gearóid will explore these insights under 3 headings – process, philosophy and practicalities.
              </p>
              <p class="speaker_info">
              Gearóid is a 24 year-old Irish guy who runs a one-man design studio in London. He has worked as an editorial designer with the News of the World, The Irish Times and the Sun. He welcomes our new online overlords in “the cloud”.

              <h4><span>Nadine Roßa:</span> The letter ß </h4>
              <p>
                For some people it is a trouble-maker in German orthography, for some a shortcoming in typography but to Nadine it is the most beautiful letter – The German Eszett.
                Throughout history no other character has had to put up with so much and almost no other letter has been the subject of so much discussion. Her surname contains this rare character. That’s the reason why, in her thesis, she decided to put some thought into what could be done to place it in a better light. That was the basis of the project »Eine scharfe Type« – A sharp character.

FontFont is the world’s largest library of original contemporary typefaces. Together with Ivo Gabrowitsch and Jörg Haubrichs, head of marketing and developer at FontFont, the team at Edenspiekermann redesigned the website from scratch in a collaborative and agile way.

And of course beyond Adobe, who needs a flat demo of an interactive Design anyways, after all rapid prototyping has been around a while.<br />>His talk will showcase different case of Tool combinations, how they fit in a real world workflow and the own choice always seems superior to everyone elses.

                Get ideas and learn the tricks to make your own bookmarklets, and

                What is a bookmarklet? A bookmarklet is a way to inject a JavaScript

                you step-by-step how to create and distribute tiny (or big!)

          <p>
            On December 14th we are going to gather for a special Christmas edition of our meet-up. Let’s enjoy some mulled wine, munch cookies and hear a lightning talk or two.
            If you want to share a cool new tool, technology or case that fits into the web design frontend category in a lightning talk (~5min), you are very welcome to share it with us.
          </p>

          <p>
            We would also like to plan the next meet-ups with you! Which topics do you want to discuss or would you like to be discussed? Do you think theme nights like the last one make sense or would you rather go for mixed evenings, etc.
            This is also a great chance to give us feedback about past events.
          </p>

          <p>PS: Baked some tasty cookies, bring ’em! :-)</p>

              <p>Open data is everywhere. Institutions and companies all around us start to open up their databases, provide APIs and give the Web community the power to build applications on top. But what if we could combine all that open data to build apps no only of one open data silo, but multiple, by cross-linking all that data data? Wouldn’t that be much more powerful?<br />This talk gives an intro to how this little idea - four years ago - became the Linking Open Data project, with hundreds of connected data sources.</p>

                Georgi is the founder of Uberblic Labs, a company of data geeks in Berlin. He developed <a href="http://dbpedia.org">DBpedia</a>, one of the first Linked Data projects, and helped organisations such as the BBC to use the Web as their database.

              <p>Handheld electronics, location devices, telecommunications networks, and a wide assortment of tags and sensors are constantly producing a rich stream of data reflecting various aspects of urban life. Managed well, “big data” can be used to unlock new sources of economic value, provide new insights into scions and hold governments to account. Meanwhile, some of the world’s foremost architects, planners, policymakers, builders, and thinkers are trying to understand this data to harness it for answers to our biggest problems.<br />In this talk, Edial Dekker will address the benefits of seeing cities as a platform that is able to reinvent itself. A main theme in this talk will be the role of data visualizations and a project called City Crawlers Berlin.</p>

              Wolfram Kriesing picks up the current hype around apps and HTML5. Is the app store only a temporary thing? Most apps can be built using web technologies. More and more APIs are coming to the browser. Will a native app still be around in the future, do we need them or just the company that gets the 30% share off of every app? He will show you what web technologies can do where you maybe thought only an app could go, and will also show an outlook of where we are heading.
