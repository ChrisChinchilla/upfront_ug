              In June we have talks by Martin Spindler, Horia Dragomir and Alex Feyerke. As always, up.front takes place at <a href="http://co-up.de/">co.up co-working</a> in Kreuzberg. <strong>NEW: For the first time we’ll use co.up’s brand new rooms in the third floor. This means more space for you and less stairs to walk.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Afterwards we are heading to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=217650843440300277520.0004b2f26bdc18ca851eb&msa=0&ll=52.497419,13.424527&spn=0.00068,0.001742">Lugosi</a> for cheap drinks and nice chats. We are looking forward to seeing you!

                <h4><span>Martin Spindler:</span> Designing for the “Internet of Things”</h4>
                <p>
                  Computers are getting ever cheaper, smaller and more energy efficient. This leads to an ever-increasing amount of digital hybrids — everyday objects equipped with digital capabilities. But this emerging new class of “computers”, often dubbed the Internet of Things, demands new interfaces that accommodate those new capabilities. What does it mean to design for the Internet of Things, then?

                <p>
                  Computers are tools that help people accomplish tasks by making the process easier, faster, cheaper, less error-prone, or just more fun.
                  But what tasks? And by what process? What parts of the process can the computer make better? How can users interact with the computer to make it do its part of the process? Only lastly can we ask: what must be presented to the user and how?
                </p>
                <p class="speaker_info">
                  Tiffany is a Canadian living in Berlin doing front-end development and interaction design at SoundCloud at SoundCloud.

               It’s up.front 25! Spring is here, and so is our first Really Rather Big Number™ meetup. We’ve found some great speakers for our 25th edition, and we’re very much looking forward to both you and them.
            </p>
            <p>
               Up.front takes place in the comfy confines of the <a href="http://co-up.de/">co.up co-working space</a> in Kreuzberg, Adalbertstraße 7-8, on the 10th of April at 19:30.
             </p>

             <p>
               Spread the word, show us cool stuff, learn new things at up.front.ug!

                <h4><span>Kelly Sutton, LayerVault:</span> From MVP to business in 9 months</h4>

                <p>LayerVault started as a Quora thread. "What are the tools or methods to manage design files?" Allan Grinshtein sent Kelly Sutton (me) an IM, "Man it sucks to be a designer. Think you could build something?" Sutton had a prototype ready to show off the next Monday. Nine months later, they are used by the best designers worldwide.</p>

                <p>While the days of LayerVault are still extremely early, there are quite a few lessons learned. Is "just ship it" always the best advice? What’s the best way to deal with copycats? How can I work as fast as humanly possible?</p>

                <p class="speaker_info">Kelly Sutton is a software developer from New York City. He’s currently traveling the world. In the past, he’s made HackCollege and the Cult of Less and worked for blip.tv and Gilt Groupe.</p>

                <p>
                  Urbany is a new iPhone App we launched last week
                  that integrates many of your favorite location apps into one interface.
                  <a href="http://netzwertig.com/2012/02/08/cafe-restaurant-und-ausgehtipps-urbany
                  -ist-das-ultimative-empfehlungs-mashup/">Netzwertig.com</a> called it "the ultimate location mashup". In this talk we will share our experiences designing and developing Urbany.
                  We will walk you through the rationale of some of our design decisions
                  (both the intentional and the incidental ones), we will talk about
                  climbing to top of the travel category in the German App Store in just
                  48 hours, and we will confuse correlation with causation a lot.

               This month we’ll be hosting a crowd-based experiment in collaborative consumption (of cookies and beer) in the festive atmosphere of a bar named after an actor known for playing Dracula, Santa’s arch nemesis. So it all makes sense.
               </p>
               <p>
               Come and join us at Lugosi (corner of Reichenberger and Manteuffel in Kreuzberg) at 20:00 on December 13th, enjoy some beers and Cola from Corsica (seriously, they have that there). We'll provide a variety of cookies and other portable nomables, but feel free to bring some of your own as well. See you all there!

                    On Tuesday, November 8th, we featured Ivo Gabrowitsch, Nadine Roßa and Javier Diaz, plus a lightning talk on Usability Testing by <a href="http://twitter.com/jancborchardt">Jan-C. Borchardt</a>.
                  </p>

                      <h4><span>Ivo Gabrowitsch:</span> App Fonts – The New Web Fonts</h4>
                      <p>
                        Though we’ve barely even had time to get used to Webfonts, the next big challenge is already looming on the horizon for font users and manufacturers: fonts for apps and mobile devices. As with Webfonts, which have already become practically indispensable, there are a myriad of special considerations involved, including technical matters and, more importantly, legal issues. This presentation aims to sensitize both developers and graphic designers to this dicey topic and to introduce possibilities for secure embedding of mobile fonts.
                      </p>
                      <p class="speaker_info">
                        Ivo Gabrowitsch is the Marketing Director of the FontFont typeface library. He was responsible for the development and introduction of the unique ‘Web FontFonts’ concept onto the market. The gratuated engineer in print and media technology studied at Beuth University of Applied Sciences in Berlin and used to work as a media designer.

                      <p>
                        When starting a consulting/agency business, there are a few things to do: Find a beautiful office, hire kick-ass developers and brilliant designers, and &hellip; get your own web site online.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The latter seems easy at first but can be the greatest challenge of all as we noticed when founding LAUNCH/CO. In this talk we’ll talk about the ever-lasting process of launching our own website and what we’ve learned.
                      </p>
                      <p class="speaker_info">
                        Nadine Roßa is a designer, illustrator and a co-founder of LAUNCH/CO together with Jan Schulz-Hofen.

                      <p>
                        As mid-life crisis hit Javi hard on the head and fellow designers &amp; friends
                        kept on asking him the same questions about improving their technique or getting better at designing, He started wondering: “What did I learn those years that could be helpful for others?
                        What kind of advice would I give myself as a designer if I was travelling 10 years back in time?”
                      </p>

                        Although we spend lots of time and money on designing our interfaces, we don't always pay the same kind of attention to sounds. Marco's talk is about finding out when to use sound and what sounds are good to use in your interface.

                      <p>
                        Agile development has long become the standard way of creating web applications. Still, many teams struggle to integrate interface design and other visual disciplines into their workflow. For the past five months, we have been one of them. As we developed a web application from ground up, we had to figure out how to keep developers and designers in sync – without slowing down the project. In this talk we'd like to share our learnings on how to set up and run a successful team with a maximum of agility – under real-world conditions. Hop the truck and keep your wrenches ready.

                      <p>
                        Every company thinks about how to present their app. But is it more important to present the company’s style or to make an app that looks good on its platform? Is it more important to have a light blue status bar or to have one that doesn’t break your own guidelines. That’s what Max Fellmuth wants to discuss with you. Max spends his whole day doing UI design (and school) and will give some insights to good and also bad branding in apps.

              <p>
                Now that web designers suddenly face the challenge (and delight) of choosing fonts from an ever-growing selection, it’s a good time to recommend some basic principles for making wise type choices.

              <h4><span>Gearóid O’Rourke:</span> Taking print design online</h4>
              <p>
              Newspapers are dying. Print is dead. All hail the online revolution! It has felled the inky beasts. Oh the confidence of teenagers. Web design is a discipline in it’s adolescence — the classic teenager; all existential angst, bad fashion choices, mood swings and earnest attempts at “cool”. It has rightly rejected the mistakes, constraints and pitfalls of “fuddy-duddy” print design, but has forgotten that old-man print still has more than a few things to teach.<br />
              Gearóid spent his teenage years in the world of newspapers. As the youngest designer at Ireland’s oldest newspaper he learned print design from the old hands. Teaching himself web design at the same time, he became fascinated by the insights a grounding in print design can offer to the web designer who is willing to listen. Gearóid will explore these insights under 3 headings – process, philosophy and practicalities.
              </p>
              <p class="speaker_info">
              Gearóid is a 24 year-old Irish guy who runs a one-man design studio in London. He has worked as an editorial designer with the News of the World, The Irish Times and the Sun. He welcomes our new online overlords in “the cloud”.

                For some people it is a trouble-maker in German orthography, for some a shortcoming in typography but to Nadine it is the most beautiful letter – The German Eszett.
                Throughout history no other character has had to put up with so much and almost no other letter has been the subject of so much discussion. Her surname contains this rare character. That’s the reason why, in her thesis, she decided to put some thought into what could be done to place it in a better light. That was the basis of the project »Eine scharfe Type« – A sharp character.

            On December 14th we are going to gather for a special Christmas edition of our meet-up. Let’s enjoy some mulled wine, munch cookies and hear a lightning talk or two.
            If you want to share a cool new tool, technology or case that fits into the web design frontend category in a lightning talk (~5min), you are very welcome to share it with us.
          </p>

          <p>
            We would also like to plan the next meet-ups with you! Which topics do you want to discuss or would you like to be discussed? Do you think theme nights like the last one make sense or would you rather go for mixed evenings, etc.
            This is also a great chance to give us feedback about past events.
          </p>

          <p>PS: Baked some tasty cookies, bring ’em! :-)</p>

              <p>Open data is everywhere. Institutions and companies all around us start to open up their databases, provide APIs and give the Web community the power to build applications on top. But what if we could combine all that open data to build apps no only of one open data silo, but multiple, by cross-linking all that data data? Wouldn’t that be much more powerful?<br />This talk gives an intro to how this little idea - four years ago - became the Linking Open Data project, with hundreds of connected data sources.</p>

              <p>Handheld electronics, location devices, telecommunications networks, and a wide assortment of tags and sensors are constantly producing a rich stream of data reflecting various aspects of urban life. Managed well, “big data” can be used to unlock new sources of economic value, provide new insights into scions and hold governments to account. Meanwhile, some of the world’s foremost architects, planners, policymakers, builders, and thinkers are trying to understand this data to harness it for answers to our biggest problems.<br />In this talk, Edial Dekker will address the benefits of seeing cities as a platform that is able to reinvent itself. A main theme in this talk will be the role of data visualizations and a project called City Crawlers Berlin.</p>

              <p>Webfonts seem to be the new savior in webdesign. We are free from Verdana, Helvetica and Georgia, finally! Or actually could be. In fact, one hardly knows anything about the implementation of commercial fonts on the web. I want to give a short introduction to typekit, .woff, .eot &amp; co, but rather want to hear about your opinions and experiences.</p>

              <p>Alex and Sven – Developer and Designer at Edenspiekermann – will share their experience relaunching the design agency’s website in a 2-day-marathon. They’ll offer insight into the tools they used, and explain why they kicked out their CMS in favour of a mostly static solution. Learn about the roadblocks they encountered in the last few minutes, and why this rapid reboot is more than just an academic exercise.</p>

                For once, Apple may have actually gotten it right with their
                advertising: The iPhone 4 changed everything. At least, if you’re an
                interface designer. Dealing with different resolutions and screen
                sizes adds another dimension to both conceptual and technical
                interface design. My talk provides some basic thoughts and approaches
                concerning this issue.

              <p>
              Wolfram Kriesing picks up the current hype around apps and HTML5. Is the app store only a temporary thing? Most apps can be built using web technologies. More and more APIs are coming to the browser. Will a native app still be around in the future, do we need them or just the company that gets the 30% share off of every app? He will show you what web technologies can do where you maybe thought only an app could go, and will also show an outlook of where we are heading.
