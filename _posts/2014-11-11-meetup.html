    <h4><span>Mariusz Ciesla:</span>Making animations make sense</h4>
    <p>
      Judging by the number of animated GIFs on Dribbble, we can probably all tell that fancy animations and transitions are all the rage in interaction design. How do we make sure they add to the experience, rather than being a fancy distraction, though?</p>
    <p class="speaker_info">
      Mariusz is a designer, developer and co-founder of <a href="http://www.lifetramp.com">Lifetramp.com</a>. He’s a big fan of both animations and good user experience, which led him to running a Gibbon playlist about designing meaningful UI animations. Really bad at maintaining balance on a skateboard.
