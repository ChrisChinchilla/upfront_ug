    <h4><span>Ferdinand Vogler:</span> Getting Web-Typography just right with SASS</h4>
    <p>
    “95% of the information on the web is written language” (Oliver Reichenstein). Striving for typographic structure, hierachy and legibility across various devices should be a must in every designers skillset. In this speech I want to show you the basics of well-set type and how SASS can be a powerful ally to achieve that.
    </p>
    <p class="speaker_info">
      Ferdinand is a communication design student in fifth semester at HTW Berlin and started his work as a design and web-development freelancer just over a year ago.
