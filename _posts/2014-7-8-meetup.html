    <h4><span>Spiros Martzoukos</span> Lessons from the FontShop site relaunch</h4>
    <p>
      After having worked for months on the Front End part of the new FontShop site relaunch, Spiros has learnt a lot of lessons, solved many problems and created others. He will share how the team used BEM and never looked back at tangled styles and specificity issues, integrated OOCSS and a living style guide in the process, used Angular to quickly set up complex applications within the site and what challenges they faced with Sass loading times.
    </p>
    <p class="speaker_info">
      Spiros comes from Greece, is half Japanese and works in a German agency, Edenspiekermann, as a Front End Developer. His code is as schizophrenic as that.
