  Wow, it's March already. We have of course an up.front meetup planned! We happily announce two amzing talks for the next second Tuesday, March 10th!
  <br><br>
  After our amazing and well attended meetup in February, where Johan Dettmar's talk "Creativity How?" inspired us all, this month it is Virginie Caplet's turn to tell us about another aspect of the matter that affects us all time and again: Creativity blocks. Danila reminds us of an old but proven mind-set for better learning
.<br><br>
  To catch up with up.front you can follow all ongoings on <a href="https://twitter.com/upfront_ug">twitter</a> and on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/up-front-ug/">meetup.com</a>.
  <br><br>
  PS: If you have something that you enjoy speaking about and want to share with an audience, make it into a talk <a href="/submit.html">submission</a>! We canâ€™t wait to read about it. Especialy we want to encourage female speakers and speakers of other underrepresented groups at tech meetups as well as not yet speakers of the respective groups to give it a shot at up.front. We do our best to live up to our reputation as the friendliest meetup in town ;). (No offence)  
  <br><br>
  Last but not least: Kristina is back from San Francisco and we would love celebrate this together. So tell all your colleagues and friends and join us!

    <h4><span>Vi Caplet:</span> Moving the creativity blocks</h4>
    <p>
Creativity had become a must-have quality in most jobs nowadays. However we sometimes witness we are unable to put ideas and solutions into action. This is what we call creativity blocks. Let's learn to identify the blocking situations as early as possible in order to finally kick their asses.

    <h4><span>Danila Pellicani:</span>Learn to code - The punk rock way!</h4>
    <p>
Learning is always hard work, learn to code is even harder, especially if you want to do it on your own. We'll stage dive on the punk rock culture to understand how the DIY attitude can help you learning and can give you the freedom to do whatever you want!
