    <h4><span>David Owens:</span>The Virtues of Cities and How to Rebuild Them</h4>
    <p>
      The earliest human settlements were founded, and grew, thanks to the benefits of shared resources and communal ways of working. After the industrial revolution city growth exploded to produce the global megacities we are familiar with today.
      <br>
These megacities are often missing the personal relationships that were the reasons for their original founding. Cities have grown to serve the global economy before their citizens.
      <br>
Connected cities and the sharing economy point to ways that we can recover some of those lost benefits of city living. How can we as designers and developers contribute to sustainable, livable and social cities?

      David Owens works as Principal Web Developer at AKQA. He’s fascinated by cities, networks and the boundaries between the physical and digital worlds.
