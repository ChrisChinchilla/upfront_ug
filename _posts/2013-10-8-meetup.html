  For our October meetup we go beyond product and development techniques and learn about what it takes to manage and communicate in projects and what it takes to make your product stand out.

    <h4><span>Rebecca Conrad & Lisa Passing:</span> Rails Girls SoC - All for one and one for all</h4>
    <p>
      Rails Girls Summer of Code is a global event which focuses on bringing more women into the world of open source software and helping participants to further expand their knowledge and skills in programming. 33 students got the chance to work paid and full-time on their projects, attend tech conferences and even speak on them. This all wouldn´t haven been possible without a great team of volunteers, organizers and sponsors. Lisa (implementing the webdesign) and Rebecca (adding illustrations) will talk a little more about the organisation and their involvement.

    <p class="speaker_info">
      Rome-born, Berlin-based Francesco is a caffeine addict who toils away day and sometimes night as a freelance UX designer and project manager for various web agencies and startups in Berlin in order to support his tragic habit. He tries his best not to increase the pervasive ugliness and thoughtlessness, for bad design makes him weep.

    <h4><span>Behrad Mirafshar:</span> Design habits</h4>
    <p>
      Our digital life is bombarded by apps. However, we use few of them on a daily basis. This does
      not mean that the other apps are not well­designed, this is basically because they are unable to
      make mark in our life and to create a habit for us. This talk endeavours to explore what we
      deliver behind our apps.
