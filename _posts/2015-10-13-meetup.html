  Summer’s over, time to get cozy and come together for up.front 61 with talks about SVGs, UX, and other strange tales about websites.
</p>

<ul class="talks">

    <h4><span>Florian Stolzenhain:</span> Responsive Spritemaps</h4>
    <p>
      Spritemaps are a pretty ancient (by webdesign measures) method to manage frontend performance and workflow. They hold up pretty well in the light of recent concepts like icon fonts, SVG’s &lt;use&gt; and data64-enconding, especially considering that they are pretty easy to adapt in a responsive enviroment and retina displays. The talk discusses two strategies with demos, pros and cons and offers some feedback on questions.

    <h4><span>Mims H. Wright:</span> The sad, strange tale of the boy with only one finger OR an introduction to how binary is used to make websites</h4>
    <p>
      Most people know that computers are "just a bunch of ones and zeroes," but few understand what that really means. How do ones and zeros become numbers, words, and pictures? This talk starts at the beginning, explaining binary numbers and shows how they are used to describe basic datatypes. We begin to uncover what the statement "just a bunch of ones and zeroes" really means.
