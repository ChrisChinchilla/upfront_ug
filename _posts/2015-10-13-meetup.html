  Whoa! Hey there! Yeah, it’s us again, sooner than expected! We took a break from our regular rhythm due to last month’s wwwtfest, and now we’re back in our regular groove: every second Tuesday of the month. We hope you’ve taken the last few weeks to recuperate from said fest and all the conferences and parties implied by it, and are up to join us for our 61st meetup!

    <h4><span>Florian Stolzenhain:</span> Responsive Spritemaps</h4>
    <p>
      Spritemaps are a pretty ancient (by webdesign measures) method to manage frontend performance and workflow. They hold up pretty well in the light of recent concepts like icon fonts, SVG’s &lt;use&gt; and data64-enconding, especially considering that they are pretty easy to adapt in a responsive enviroment and retina displays. The talk discusses two strategies with demos, pros and cons and offers some feedback on questions.

    <h4><span>Mims H. Wright:</span> The sad, strange tale of the boy with only one finger OR an introduction to how binary is used to make websites</h4>
    <p>
      Most people know that computers are "just a bunch of ones and zeroes," but few understand what that really means. How do ones and zeros become numbers, words, and pictures? This talk starts at the beginning, explaining binary numbers and shows how they are used to describe basic datatypes. We begin to uncover what the statement "just a bunch of ones and zeroes" really means.
