    <h4><span>Benjamin Kampmann:</span> Component-Oriented UX For The Winâ€¦ But How?</h4>
    <p>
      Understanding UI as reusable components and building it in a modular way are the new black in web development. But how exactly do you apply these latest technologies while still allowing overall themes and customization as we are used to? In this case study, we will look under the hood of beavy to understand how it uses CSS Modules and React to marry having highly complex, reusable UI-components and ensuring they can be completely customized at the same time. And what that means for the overall design process.

    <h4><span>Ariel Cotton:</span> Interdisciplinary Design</h4>
    <p>
      In addition to being a UI/UX designer and developer, Ariel is also an interactive artist and maker, and she draws and writes comics. Not seeing these as separate media, she integrates them in interdisciplinary ways. For instance, Ariel has made webcomics that are navigable through interfaces made from physical objects such as books and dolls, and illustrations that produce computer graphics and sounds when touched. In her talk she will review key points in her approach to interdisciplinary design, show some of her work, and discuss the tools she uses.
