    <h4><span>Michiel Slot:</span> Product Ownership: Captain Obvious speaks about owning and shipping</h4>
     <p>
       Are you a Product Owner? Maybe not by all definitions, though Michiel believe every developer or designer involved in a project is a Product Owner. Michiel found some obvious stuff about dealing with product ownership he will share with you.
     </p>
     <p class="speaker_info">
       Michiel has lengthy experience both as project manager and frontend developer on projects large and small. He likes smooth user interfaces and appreciates nerdy tricks. Besides leading a team of interactive heads at Viacom he organises WebVisions Berlin 2014.

    <h4><span>Gunnar Bittersmann:</span> Sassematics</h4>
    <p>
    Sass + mathematics. Many web developers nowadays use CSS preprocessors, and do simple calculations like ($a + $b) * $c in them. But we can do more. Much more: sin, cos, tan, … and calculate square roots like the ancient Babylonians. A short trip into geometry. Bring your rulers and compasses!
    </p>
    <p class="speaker_info">
      As a frontend developer on the whatever-first path, Gunnar aims at a better understanding between humans and machines. He helps organizing the World Usability Day Berlin and struggles not to forget how to play the guitar.
