    <h4><span>Jeanny Wang:</span> Design for uncertainty</h4>
    <p>
      In today’s increasingly demanding, connected marketplace with ever-changing technological possibilities, uncertainty is no longer an exception, but a norm. Whereas build first, fail fast and often is the name of the game, this talk proposes and asks whether it’s possible to apply a fail forward approach using human-centric, collaborative methods of inclusion to connect with, rather than confront, uncertainty in today’s fast-paced business landscape.

    <h4><span>Jennifer Geacone-Cruz:</span> The not-so-Zen art of the Japanese website</h4>
    <p>
       Oceans of text, long load times; Japanese websites are hardly minimal and often not user-friendly. But why are Japanese websites, so, well... Japanese? The answer is very much cultural and only a little bit technical. This talk will provide a foot in the sliding shoji door of the sometimes frustrating, but fascinating world of Japanese websites and frontend.
