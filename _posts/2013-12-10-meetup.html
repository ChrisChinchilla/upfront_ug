    <h4><span>Frank Leue:</span> Building shapeshifting interfaces</h4>
    <p>
      Building things on the web is great. Especially just now as responsive design solved lots of our problems. But taking a glimpse at the near future you’ll see not only desktops, tablets and phones. There will be watches and super large TV sets. Interaction with those devices will not necessarily include your fingertips anymore but very likely gestures and voice control.
    While the emerging internet of things is going to surround us with connected devices constantly providing or collecting data, we need to think about how to build consistent experiences throughout the day.
    This talk is about how to build frontends that adopt to contexts and provide consistent information and a continuity of your brand across devices.
