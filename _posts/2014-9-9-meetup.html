It's official: we're old! 50 years of up.front! Well, nearly. After more than four years and about 100 different speakers from all over the world and what feels like most of Berlin's tech scene, we now reconvene for a celebratory recap with some of our veteran speakers, one from each of the past three years. So please join us on Tuesday, the 9th of September, for the 50th edition of our humble little meetup.
