  up.front is a user group focused on web design &amp; frontend development topics, based in Berlin.
  Every month we meet at <a href="http://co-up.de" title="co-up.de">co.up</a>, a co-working space in Kreuzberg, where we discuss everything related to webdesign and frontend development. Everyone is welcome to participate, either by attending or holding a talk themselves. We are very much looking forward to your talk proposals, be it a keynote or a 5 minute chat about your latest find on the web.
