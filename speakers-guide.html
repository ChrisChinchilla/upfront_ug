<h2>Speakers Guide</h2>

<p>
  <br><br>
  Dear speaker,
  <br><br>
We’re happy you’d like to give a talk at up.front.ug! Our meetup is focused on web design and frontend development topics. Every month we meet at <a href="http://co-up.de" title="co-up.de">co.up</a>, a co-working space in Kreuzberg, where we regularly attract a crowd of 70 people and more, most of them frontend engineers and webdesigners. Our events are free and open for everyone, questions and discussions are encouraged.
</p>

<h3 id="information">Your Talk and Required Information</h3>

<p>
  Talks should be no longer than 20 minutes. We’ll provide a countdown so you can check your timing during the talk. We do not take questions from the audience – there’ll be time for discussion at the end of the meetup.
</p>
<p>
  Please provide us with the following information so we can announce your talk <!--(and if you are familiar with HTML, please use <a href="https://gist.github.com/Kriesse/6762161">this template</a>)-->, also make sure that your abstract and bio are written as third person statements (e.g. <i>"In this talk Laura will talk about…"</i> instead of <i>"In this talk I will talk about…"</i>):
</p>

<ul class="talks">

   <li class="talk_example">
     <h4><span>Your Name:</span> Title of your talk</h4>
     <p>
       Short abstract (3-5 sentences) of your talk, e.g.: What is your main question? What is your hypothesis? What will people learn? If it is a technical talk, what is the level (beginner, advanced, expert) and what knowledge is needed to be able to follow along (e.g. HTML, CSS)?
     </p>
     <p class="speaker_info">
       A sentence about yourself, what you are working on or whatever you want to let people know about yourself.
     </p>

<h3 id="commercial">Commercial Announcements in Talks</h3>
<p>
  We are very grateful for you to speak at up.front! So if you want to let the audience know about your cool Open Source project, an event you are organizing, or that your company is hiring, you are very welcome to mention that while you’re on stage. Just please keep commercial shout-outs short and excite the crowd with the content of your talk.
</p>

  For small announcements or very quick topics we can also give you a slot for a lightning talk. They are usually held before or after a break. Please make sure you stay within the following requirements:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lightning talks shouldn't be longer than 2-3 minutes. After 5 minutes we will ask you to stop immediately but you should not take the chance.</li> 
  <li>You should not have more than one slide.</li>
  <li>Our <a href="#commercial">requirements for commercial announcements</a> also apply for lightning talks.</li>
</ul>

</p>
